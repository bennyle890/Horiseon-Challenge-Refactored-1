# Horiseon Challenge Refactored 

## The Repository

This repository ("Horiseon-Challenge-Refactored-1") is a refactored version of the Horiseon website utilizing [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). A common tasks of a front-end and junior developer is to utilize existing codes and refactor it. When you refactor a code, you improve the overall code and simplify it without changing the actions or properties. Doing so, it allows for the existing site to become more accessible, which is an important consideration for businesses. This creates a a cleaner and easier to read/understand. Being able to solve this problem, software developers are able to find and fix bugs or vulnerabilities within the code much easier.

Refactoring this project allows me to enhance my skills in becoming a possible full-stack web developer. Working in the field of coding, you usually will have someone to check over your work and refactor it to create a more accessible website. 

From this project, I was able to learn that many html/css codes could be simplified by placing them into a single group instead of individual groups when they code for the same thing. For example, three classes that code for the same thing can be simplified into one class.

  i.e.
  * .back-star {
     * background-color: blue;
      }
  * .back-moon {
     * background-color: blue;
      }
  * .back-sun {
     * background-color: blue;
      }
      
  Can be simplified into one class (for example, .back-galaxy) and changed in the html as well,
  * .back-galaxy {
     * background-color: blue;
      }
